    <img width = 400px src="images/IMG_20160814_155638.jpg" alt="Me on the peak of Golden Ears">
    <p>Golden Ears is a summit in British Columbia that stands at a whooping 1716m above sea level.</p>
    <p>Golden Ears and I have a special relationship because I can see it from my house in Coquitlam.</p>
    <p>Here are some things I love about this peak:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>It's a beautiful thing to watch the sun rise over</li>
    	<li>It's always snowy</li>
    	<li>You have an amazing view from the summit</li>
    	<li>It's an excellent workout to get to the top (takes 10-12 hours round trip to summit)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Golden Ears is a beautiful place that means a lot to me. You can learn more about it <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Ears_(peaks)">here</a></p>
